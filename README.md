This was supposed to be a full functioning weather app. Unfortunately, Open Weather Map API placed pricing on their "onecall" service. which is what i would use to generate the Hourly and Daily Forecast.

I would leave the fetch logic in the WeatherService.jsx file.

For now, Enjoy the UI of the application.

## Description

This was implemented this using REACT JS and Tailwind CSS.<br>The website is mobile responsive.<br>

This was supposed to be a full functioning weather app. Unfortunately, `Open Weather Map API` placed pricing on their `onecall` service. which is what i would use to generate the Hourly and Daily Forecast.

```js
const formattedForecastWeather = async () =>
//here nothing will be fetched cause the onecall service is not available for free users
    await getWeatherData("onecall", {
      lat,
      lon,
      exclude: "current,minutely,alerts",
      units: searchParams.units,
    }).then(formatForecastWeather);
  console.log(formattedCurrentWeather);
  return { ...formattedCurrentWeather, ...formattedForecastWeather };
};
```

I would leave the fetch logic in the `WeatherService.jsx` file.

For now, Enjoy the UI of the application.
